# Aloha

This site is a creation by RED Academy to show students proficiency in HTML, CSS, and use of jQuery plugins. This site is based off of a fictional clothing website, which features smooth scrolling, a featured items carousel, a subscription section, and general site information, such as about, types of clothing/accessories, and social media and contact information.

# Reflections

In this site, I learned important skills, such as using media queries, the specificity of CSS, and the importance of mobile first styling. As so much of our media is viewed on smaller and smaller screens, using media queries to differentiate between the screen sizes and ensure that the site is easy to navigate across platforms is becoming increasingly important.
