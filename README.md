# Aloha

Aloha is a website built to display my proficiency at html, css, and small amounts of jQuery. The site itself is a clothing website, which includes a navigation bar with smool scrolling, a main banner, a section about the company itself, how to access the shops and products, a featured items carousel, a subscription box, and a footer containing the information and social media of the site.

# Getting started

Any code editor will work for this site, as a standard editor was used, and jquery and javascript cdn's were used in place of downloads.

# Code Style

This was done with standard html, css, and jQuery markup. Through css, I used primarily flexbox to place the images in their correct positions on the page, as well as sections in html. The jQuery plug in was used to intiate the smooth scrolling as well as the carousel.
